 ./launch.sh		// to test launching gazebo and rviz


 ./test_slam.sh 	// to test mapping and localization
			   part of this is to use teleop package to manually drive robot around to create a 2D map for navigation


 ./test_navigation 	// to test 2D navigation goal in rviz for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance
			   localization is shown in rviz while robot navigates the environment


 ./pick_object		// to test sending robot to two different locations one after the other
			   this ROS node publishes destinattion coordinates (respected to world frame) to the robot 


 ./add_marker		// to test object pickup/drop-off by spawnign a virtual box at one location
			   once robot navigates to the box, box disappears and re-appears again at when
			   robot arrives at the destination
			   this ROS node subcribes to robot's AMCL


 ./home_service		// to test the final project: end-to-end autonomous navigation and collision avoidance to pick up 
			   and drop-off a box
